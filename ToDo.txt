- Determine whether taking the top 50% of feature weights for creating cutoffs is ideal

- Two methods to determine final cluster membership:
	1. Subjects that form tight cluster keep their cluster membership. Only subjects that are not part of these tight clusters have their membership predicted from regional cut-offs.
	2. Tight clusters are used to generate regional cutoffs, but then all subjects have membership predicted from these. This means it is possible that a subject belonging to one tight cluster may be classified as part of another cluster. For instance, a member of the PIB- tight cluster may be classified as PIB+ because one of their regions surpasses the cutoff.

- Cluster labels are arbitrary and may switch from one resample to another. The calc_cutoffs relabels to 'pos' and 'neg' based on which set of features has a higher mean. Should be ok, but maybe there is a better way? 

- calc_cutoffs function is somewhat verbose. Would it make sense to operate on a single groupedby dataframe rather than creating separate datraframes for each group?

- Need to insert tests:
	- Currently, the column containing cluster weights and membership in each resample is labeled as int value '0'. This works in the context of the main script as R generates this as the column label. However, if functions are to be used independently it may be worthwhile to explicitly name this column or select using data[data.columns[0]]. 
	- Verify that original datafile if in correct format (ie. first column is subject codes, all remaining columns are features)
